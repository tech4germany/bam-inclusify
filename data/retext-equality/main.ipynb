The list below mainly includes the illnesses mentioned in the `retext-equality` disability list. The list could probably be much much longer. Some words for ill people and illnesses are rather rare and not yet in the POS tagger dictionary, so we add them there, see `added.txt`. A better approach in the mid term would be to use a neural tagger, though."
